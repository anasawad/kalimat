#summary An explanation of the assembly language for the SmallVM runtime.
The VM takes a string as an input, which represents code in a special assembly language. 

This assembly code has elements of 3 types:
 * Instructions
 * Class definitions
 * Method definitions (the term _method_ here means both normal functions and class member functions).

= Instructions =
An instruction is always on one line. It takes this form:

`label: opcode args @tag`

The _label_ and _tag_ parts are optional, and the arguments vary according to the specific instruction.

For example:
 * `pushv 12`
 * `poplocal x@14543`
 * `top: add`
